# About

Open Source Energy News provides a single platform for accessing the latest energy sector news without opinion or bias. We do not store data on historical articles or article content, instead focusing on displaying the headlines from a wide array of sources. We welcome contributions to the website development and recommendations for new sources, the code repository can be found [here](https://github.com/AyrtonB/Energy-News-Site).

What's on our roadmap?

- Adding new sources
- Automatic tag generation and cleaning
- Source filter
