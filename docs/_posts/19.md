lead: "<p>Electric school buses just might&nbsp;be the breakout vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology in the United States. At least, that&rsquo;s how Duncan McIntyre, CEO of Highland Electric Transportation, sees it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>McIntyre, who&nbsp;founded&nbsp;renewable energy procurement and analysis marketplace Altenex in 2011 and sold it to Edison International in 2015, started Highland Electric two years ago to build a &ldquo;business entirely around the school bus electrification market.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The idea is to replace the upfront and ongoing costs of EV buses and charging infrastructure with a fixed annual fee, equal to or less than a school district&rsquo;s current budget for owning, fueling and maintaining their existing diesel-fueled fleets. Highland finances the arrangement and recoups the investment by finding ways to earn money from the new fleet&rsquo;s battery capacity when the buses are&nbsp;not on the road.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A major part of that equation relies on tapping their energy storage capacity for soaking up low-cost overnight or midday power &mdash; and more importantly, discharging it during grid-stressed evening peaks. That&rsquo;s the big difference between&nbsp;<a href='https - //www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/why-is-vehicle-to-grid-taking-so-long-to-happen' target='_blank'>V2G technologies</a>, which actively tap EV batteries, and the far more common &ldquo;V1G&rdquo; approach of simply throttling or halting EV charging to reduce grid impacts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Out of all the EVs out there, &ldquo;we think electric school buses are the killer V2G app,&rdquo; McIntyre said in an interview last week. Not only do the nearly 500,000 school buses in North America spend most of their time parked, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re idle in the middle of the day, they&rsquo;re idle in the evening, and they&rsquo;re idle all summer,&rdquo; a schedule that fits almost perfectly with emerging grid needs.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why V2G has been slow to take off&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Vehicle-to-grid isn&rsquo;t a novel technology in the U.S. One of the most widespread V2G technology platforms today was initially developed at the University of Delaware&nbsp;<a href='https - //www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/can-nuvve-make-v2g-work-in-the-real-world' target='_blank'>back in 2007</a>. San Diego-based Nuvve has built that foundational technology into a platform orchestrating EV grid services in Europe, Japan and the U.S., including a commercial V2G operation in Denmark that&rsquo;s been running&nbsp;<a href='https - //nuvve.com/four-years-of-consecutive-v2g-in-denmark/' target='_blank'>for four years</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Europe is home to&nbsp;<a href='https - //www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/how-european-evs-are-balancing-out-the-renewables-that-power-them' target='_blank'>multiple V2G projects</a>&nbsp;actively bidding into energy markets. But in the U.S., V2G opportunities have been limited by a number of factors,&nbsp;said&nbsp;Jacqueline Piero, Nuvve&rsquo;s vice president of policy.&nbsp;Adding bidirectional power flow adds complications that&nbsp;state interconnection regulations and U.S. grid operator market structures aren&rsquo;t designed to handle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But these bottlenecks have started to open. California recently revised its&nbsp;<a href='https - //www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/californias-interconnection-rules-open-doors-to-flexible-solar-storage-vehicle-to-grid-charging# - ~ - text=The%20new%20Rule%2021%20revisions%20clarify%20that%20V2G%20DC%20charging,be%20interconnected%20with%20utility%20permission.&amp;text=As%20for%20V2G%20AC%20charging,be%20ready%20to%20standardize%20it.' target='_blank'>interconnection rules to include V2G</a>&nbsp;systems, laying the groundwork for broader adoption, she said. Mid-Atlantic grid operator PJM has followed up its University of Delaware V2G pilots with tests with BMW and General Motors and is&nbsp;<a href='https - //insidelines.pjm.com/dominion-to-roll-out-largest-electric-school-bus-deployment-in-u-s/' target='_blank'>participating in a pilot</a>&nbsp;launched by Virginia utility Dominion Energy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In March, Highland Electric Transportation&nbsp;<a href='https - //www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/city-of-beverly-and-highland-electric-transportation-select-electric-school-bus-from-thomas-built-buses-powered-by-proterra-ev-technology-301014159.html' target='_blank'>landed its first deal</a>&nbsp;with the city of Beverly, Massachusetts&nbsp;to supply Thomas Built Buses&rsquo;&nbsp;electric buses powered by&nbsp;<a href='https - //www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/3-trends-making-the-case-for-bus-electrification' target='_blank'>Proterra&rsquo;s electric drivetrains</a>&nbsp;and charged with Proterra&rsquo;s 60-kilowatt charging stations. Highland is working with utility National Grid to tap its lucrative energy storage pay-for-performance incentives, and it is also exploring opportunities from grid operator ISO New England&rsquo;s emergency response program, McIntyre said.</p>

<p>Nuvve, which announced&nbsp;plans this week to go public via a special-purpose acquisition vehicle <a href='https - //www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/nuvve-electric-vehicle-to-grid-charging-pioneer-to-go-public-via-spac-reverse-merger' target='_blank'>reverse&nbsp;merger</a>, has recently started <a href='https - //nuvve.com/nuvve-corporation-announces-participation-in-californias-wholesale-energy-markets-to-help-balance-the-grid/' target='_blank'>bidding stationary battery capacity</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;the University of California at San Diego&#39;s microgrid into California state grid operator CAISO markets,&nbsp;as a precursor to tapping the microgrid&#39;s growing&nbsp;EV fleet. But not all EVs are well suited to taking part in V2G to moneymaking opportunities, Piero noted. First and foremost, EVs have &ldquo;a&nbsp;primary use that can&rsquo;t be compromised&rdquo; &mdash; serving the transportation needs of their owners.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most U.S. EV charging systems today offer incentives for&nbsp;EVs to charge with cheap and plentiful off-peak energy&nbsp;and to avoid charging when grid demand is at its peak. That will be critical to&nbsp;<a href='https - //www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/southern-california-edison-38000-ev-chargers-largest-utility-program-of-its-kind' target='_blank'>managing the grid impacts</a>&nbsp;of an EV fleet that&rsquo;s set to grow to tens of millions of vehicles in the coming decade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But EVs may not have much excess battery capacity and can face significant customer and automaker resistance to adding stress to a battery whose long-time health is critical to maintaining vehicle range and value.</p>

<p>School buses, by contrast, can carry batteries with excess capacity to provide to the grid. Proterra&rsquo;s 220-kilowatt batteries for Thomas Built school buses are capable of more than&nbsp;4,000 cycles over eight years, which means that &ldquo;more than half of their use case could be for use as a grid asset,&rdquo; CTO Dustin&nbsp;Grace said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most EVs also charge at unpredictable times and locations, making it hard to align their capabilities with the constructs of the traditional energy market and utility programs.&nbsp;EV fleets, by contrast, offer&nbsp;scale that multiplies their value&nbsp;and a single owner that can commit them to being available when they&rsquo;re most valuable to the grid.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Utilities and&nbsp;public-private partnerships are targeting the electric school bus opportunity</h2>

<p>School buses fill a unique niche in the world of fleet vehicles, Piero noted. First of all, they&rsquo;re an almost completely North American phenomenon, as most other countries rely on public transit or other transportation methods for students.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second, they&rsquo;re owned by school districts or city and county agencies open to a variety of public-private partnerships. Nuvve has been participating in California Energy Commission-funded school bus V2G pilot projects in the Southern California school districts of <a href='https - //nuvve.com/projects/torrance-electric-school-buses/' target='_blank'>Torrance</a> and&nbsp;<a href='https - //www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/06/f52/elt095_moore_2018_o.pdf' target='_blank'>Rialto</a>, partnering with&nbsp;<a href='https - //www.electrive.com/2020/09/16/v2g-charging-with-electric-school-buses-in-the-usa/' target='_blank'>bus maker Blue Bird</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An electric school bus still costs about $120,000 more than its diesel equivalent upfront&nbsp;but will save its owner about&nbsp;$170,000 to $240,000 in lifetime fuel and maintenance costs, according to&nbsp;<a href='https - //www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/school-districts-rolling-out-electric-buses'>a 2018 report</a>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Multiple avenues are emerging to bridge the resulting gap between upfront costs and long-term payback.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The California Energy Commission&rsquo;s School Bus Replacement Program&nbsp;has&nbsp;<a href='https - //www.energy.ca.gov/programs-and-topics/programs/school-bus-replacement-program' target='_blank'>dedicated&nbsp;$94 million</a>&nbsp;to help cover conversion costs for eligible districts or agencies. States including Vermont, Minnesota, Arizona and Michigan have set aside EV bus funds from their shares of Volkswagen&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href='https - //www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/volkswagens-electrify-america-breaks-ground-on-ev-charging-network-faces-sc' target='_blank'>$2 billion Dieselgate</a>&nbsp;settlement. Proterra has a&nbsp;<a href='https - //www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/proterra-rolls-out-bus-battery-leasing-program-with-mitsui' target='_blank'>$200 million credit facility</a>&nbsp;with Japan&rsquo;s Mitsui to finance leases of its electric bus batteries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Utilities are also funding electric school buses to meet state or internal transportation electrification and decarbonization goals&nbsp;and to expand into a new class of capital investment. The biggest such undertaking to date is in Virginia, where utility Dominion Energy has won regulator approval to deploy&nbsp;<a href='https - //sonnymerryman.com/news/virginias-first-electric-school-buses-have-arrived/' target='_blank'>50 electric buses</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, allowing utilities to use ratepayer funds to engage in EV markets can create concerns around potentially anti-competitive practices. Dominion has yet to win Virginia lawmakers&rsquo; backing for a plan to expand its program to&nbsp;1,000 electric school buses by 2025, with&nbsp;<a href='https - //energynews.us/2020/03/30/southeast/virginia-advocates-plan-to-jumpstart-electric-school-bus-debate-next-year/' target='_blank'>competing bills</a>&nbsp;proposing state block grants or other funding mechanisms to open the market to non-utility competitors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But most states have allowed utilities to&nbsp;<a href='https - //www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/socal-edison-seeks-760m-to-build-48000-new-ev-charging-stations' target='_blank'>invest in infrastructure</a>&nbsp;to enable EV charging while keeping the charging itself open to multiple parties, a model that could be applied to utility V2G investments. A&nbsp; five-year electric bus pilot program funded by the VW Dieselgate&nbsp;settlement in&nbsp;Michigan&nbsp;with <a href='http - //urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.proterra.com_press-2Drelease_proterra-2Dpowered-2Delectric-2Dschool-2Dbuses-2Dand-2Dproterra-2Dcharging-2Dsystems-2Dselected-2Dby-2Dmichigan-2Dschools-2Dfor-2Dvehicle-2Dto-2Dgrid-2Dpilot-2Dprogram_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=birp9sjcGzT9DCP3EIAtLA&amp;r=Jm9xWRFXRuHV4JAK0TqF7YthNTbTt_iRG-0JzDunAfc&amp;m=nSN0JStQSe5byo7W1H3DSwhXGj0NlEPqEA4_qA80mCE&amp;s=WBkop75K_KlbbkHXopFGtCqC_K57Axe98c9C78fzTdA&amp;e=' target='_blank'>Proterra and utility DTE Energy</a> will include tests of their V2G capabilities to provide backup power to buildings during emergencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Utility <a href='https - //www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/arizona-utility-aps-charts-path-to-zero-carbon-energy-by-2050' target='_blank'>Arizona Public Service</a> is also exploring the potential to partly finance electric school bus fleets for school districts in exchange for gaining access to their batteries for grid services during off-hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Judson Tillinghast, APS product development and strategy leader, noted in a recent interview that the day-to-day availability of electric school buses for V2G aligns well with the state&rsquo;s solar-driven supply-demand imbalances.&nbsp;&ldquo;There are some correlations here that really make sense in terms of a partnership.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a company centered on financing school bus V2G values, Highland is opposed to allowing utilities to own the vehicles themselves, McIntyre said. But, he added,&nbsp;&ldquo;We might argue that the utilities could own the batteries&nbsp;and treat them as distributed energy resources to support the grid.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Highland is actively developing about two dozen more deployments similar to its deal with Beverly, he said, though he wouldn&rsquo;t disclose where they are located. Nor did he provide specifics on the &ldquo;really big-balance-sheet companies&rdquo; that are providing the capital behind its contracts, though he did say the deregulated business arm&nbsp;of a Fortune 500 electric utility is among them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class='feedflare'>
